## all plots from hic experiments
this dir contains all the plots from following hic experiments. see the sample outputs below and their captions.

every experiment is outlined below. the following experiments are applied onto the dlbcl dataset:
* `simple_diff` - takes simple diff of two hic matrices to expose areas of difference.
* `pca_hic` - applies pca to hic matrix1 and matrix2. reduces noise on the matrices before comparing them. includes stat to determine which window size best eliminates noise.
* `autoencoder_hic` - applies autoencoder to hic matrices to remove noise. autoencoder is trained on original matrix and used to denoise the query matrix. 
* `mf_hic` - applied matrix factorization
* `svt_hic` - applied singular value threshold

### dlbcl dataset info
using data with chromatin conformation changes in B-cells of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient.
The bounding boxes are generated by feeding windows of 3 Mb window size, stepping 100 kb in to the CHESS extract pipeline. The below experiments perform denoising operations on chr2 of the data. The hic data produces a 121x121 matrix when loaded into computer memory. [Data Availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_large_B-cell_lymphoma)

### noise added to dlbcl data
in this experiment, noise is added with gaussian blur layers to the dlbcl data. the experiments are conducted to see how well it removes the manually added noise.
